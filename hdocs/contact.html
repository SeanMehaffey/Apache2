 <h1>Oracle Automatic Storage Management Project</h1>
 <h2>(Internship Express-Scripts)</h2>

<p> For the first part of this project, I had to shadow and learn from different Database Administrators about Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM). After that, I had to use my new knowledge to add more space to four different production databases that needed more storage using ASM. The Database Team needed me to complete this because applications storing information on an Oracle Database take in more and more data overtime. If not done properly, the applications could break costing the company thousands of dollars a minute. In order to add more space, I needed to make the right calculations for the growth of the database disk groups in a six-month time period. The next step was to figure how many disks the databases needed, construct four add disk statements in Oracle SQL, and eventually run the statements in Oracle ASM which would add more space to the database. This project as a whole was very challenging for me because I had no prior database experience with databases. Even though databases are challenging, I learned this may actually be the right career path for me after I am finished with school. Overall when I completed this project, I felt a sense of accomplishment and relief.

<h1>Intern Collaboration Project</h1>
<h2>(Internship Express-Scripts)</h2>

<p>For this project, a team of interns, including myself, were asked to develop different methods Express-Scripts could use in order to attract/retain young IT talent. The project consisted of a series of meetings over a few weeks where we discussed new methods and researched metrics to back up our new ideas. We discussed and debated the best new methods that were backed by metrics and presented our findings with a power point presentation to the heads of the IT Department. The main challenge during this project was locating meeting rooms so we could collaborate for an extended amount of time. We overcame this issue by scheduling meetings a few weeks in advance. The lesson I learned from this challenge was to schedule meetings weeks in advance. Overall, this project turned out well with the Vice-Presidents and CIO of the company taking our ideas seriously.

<h1>Microsoft Access Database Project</h1>

<p>For this project, my team had to take a schema that the instructor provided to us and turn it into a working Microsoft Access Database with data and queries. In order to accomplish this, we split the work between the three of us. I had the job of turning the schema into a working database and the others had to populate the database and make the desired queries. In the end, we made the database to the desired specifications and received an A on the project. In addition, the biggest challenge I faced working on this project was Microsoft Access. This project was the first time I used Microsoft Access so the learning curve was very large. I overcame this undertaking by using YouTube tutorials. In the end, this project became a great crash course in Microsoft Access.
